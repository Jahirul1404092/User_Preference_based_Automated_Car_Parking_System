T. PerkoviÄ‡ et al., surveyed on this parking system and they took behaviour on some sensors. They used ultrasound sensor, IR sensor, photo diode and magnetometer. They took the output signal of those sensors on car parked and on no parked state. They plotted those output signals data and compare among those sensor. They used cloud server to store data and used computer to visualize slot status \cite{PERKOVIC2020121181}. M. Prasanth et al., Proposed a system on this topic based on internet of things technology. They used Raspberry pi, IR obstacle sensor and RFID for verification. They send parking slot status to user using wifi module. They did not use any cloud server to store data or any security system \cite{prasanth12design}.
Attiqur et al., devepoloped a system where they used RFID, Raspberry pi and ultrasonic sensor. They used wifi module to send data to local mysql server. Their system has not any security feature or location system \cite{atiqursmart}. 
Koushika et al., developed a system in which they used image processing technology to identify the slot status. They collected image from CCTV and processed it using raspberry pi. They did the image processing steps like image detection, edge detetion etc. After processing image they send the slot status to remote server and using mobile application user can interact with the system. \cite{koushika2021efficient}
DivyanshuShekhar et al., proposed a system on online parking system. They made web app, the owner can post the slot status with this application and user can see the free slot area of this parking space. This system is not automated \cite{divyanshushekhar2021parkofy}. 
N. R. Siva Jyothi et al., developed their system on smart parking. They used sensor, raspberry pi, cloud server, user application and operator application. Sensors take the slot status and send to server using raspberry pi. User can entrance and exit using \cite{jyothireal}

With arduino and modem they transmit slot status to the receiver. They built up payment system using mobile application. Their application has no anti theft feature \cite{azshwanth2019automated}.
Mrs. D.J. Bonde et al., developed a system where interfaced LCD with microcontroller, interfaced GSM with microcontroller, interfacing RF module with microcontroller and developed and android application. Sensor data are sent to parking system using RF and then this status was sent to android using GSM module \cite{bonde2014automated}. 
Natarajan et al., developed car parking system where they used IR sensor for reading the status when cars enter and exit the place. They used RIO to send signals to lab view. for every slot they used led. for free and parked condition they used LEDs of different color \cite{natarajan2018design}.
Mohammed Azher Therib et al., developed a system where they used counter. When a car is entered the counter increased by one and when leave counter decreased by one. when the count is same to slot number the gate turned off by a servo motor. When count is less than slot number gate is automatically turned on \cite{doi}. 
Samir A. El-Seoud et al., developeed a system which can read car plate automatically and stores the car information in a dynamic database. Web application and android application can retrieve those data and can pay fare solution electronically \cite{el2016towards}.

\section{Hardware Specification}
\subsection{Arduino Mega 2560}
The Arduino Mega 2560 is an ATmega2560-based microcontroller board. There are 54 digital pins for input and output (of which 14 can be used as PWM outputs). It includes everything which need to support the microcontroller. A usb cable is needed to link it to computer or power it to start.

\subsection{IR Obstacle Sensor}
The infrared (IR) obstacle sensor has a pair of infrared transmitting and receiving sensors. The infrared LED emits Infrared signals at certain frequency and when an obstacle appears on the line of infrared light, it is reflected back by the obstacle which is sensed by the receiver. When an impediment is detected by the sensor the LED indicator is illuminated and a signal is given via the OUT pin. The sensor contains a potentiometer that is adjustable for changing the sensor distance.
