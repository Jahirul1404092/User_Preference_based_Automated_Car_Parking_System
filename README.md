# User_Preference_based_Automated_Car_Parking_System
It is a bachelor final year project

Car parking is one of the major problems in this modern era of life. It has been
revealed that cruising for parking is one of the main sources of road congestion
and pollution. But day by day this problem is increasing in the world which
creates traffic jam. Internet of things is a technology which combines devices
via internet and share and compute data to solve complex problems and makes
a system faster. By using this technology we can design a smart car parking
system. In this thesis, we developed a parking system where the parking spot
is connected to the internet. After checking the slot status it sends data to the
server, android application can retrieve these statuses and can request for a slot.
After some authentication user can use the slot. This system has an early alarm
and notification feature for anti-theft. we took some test case results and we got
93% accuracy.
